# LOCOFORGE: Prompt-to-DB Connector Roadmap and Validation Plan

## Overview  
 ([AI Agent for Text2SQL: The Magical Recipe for Natural Database Interactions - hiberus blog - Exploring Technology, AI, and Digital Experiences](https://www.hiberus.com/en/blog/ai-agent-for-text2sql/#:~:text=Join%20me%20as%20I%20share,adapt%20for%20your%20own%20projects)) ([AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://blog.apify.com/ai-agent-orchestration/#:~:text=Graph,making%20when%20needed))LOCOFORGE will be implemented as an AI agent pipeline: user prompts are sent to a ChatGPT-based LLM which decides how to generate the required database actions.  We adopt a LangChain + LangGraph architecture, where LangGraph orchestrates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of modular nodes (e.g. SQL-node, Mongo-node, Drive-node) and the LLM provides dynamic decision-making ([AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://blog.apify.com/ai-agent-orchestration/#:~:text=Graph,making%20when%20needed)) ([AI Agent for Text2SQL: The Magical Recipe for Natural Database Interactions - hiberus blog - Exploring Technology, AI, and Digital Experiences](https://www.hiberus.com/en/blog/ai-agent-for-text2sql/#:~:text=Join%20me%20as%20I%20share,adapt%20for%20your%20own%20projects)).  In this design, each connector (SQL, MongoDB, Google Drive) is encapsulated as a class with well-defined methods, following the Model Context Protocol (MCP) pattern of exposing resources and tools to the LLM ([mcp-python-sdk – User's blog](https://streetsdigital.com/2025/04/04/mcp-python-sdk/#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20,MCP%20servers%20can)).  The LLM (ChatGPT) is used to translate plain-English prompts into executable actions: for example, generating an SQL SELECT statement that the system then runs against a SQL database.  All query results will be returned to the user as structured JSON.  The architecture emphasises modularity (to enable new connectors) and robust orchestration, as recommended in recent Text-to-SQL agent designs ([AI Agent for Text2SQL: The Magical Recipe for Natural Database Interactions - hiberus blog - Exploring Technology, AI, and Digital Experiences](https://www.hiberus.com/en/blog/ai-agent-for-text2sql/#:~:text=,Query%20execution)) ([AI Agent for Text2SQL: The Magical Recipe for Natural Database Interactions - hiberus blog - Exploring Technology, AI, and Digital Experiences](https://www.hiberus.com/en/blog/ai-agent-for-text2sql/#:~:text=1.%20Rock,Interaction%3A%20Understands%20plain%20English%20queries)).

## sprint 1: MVP – Foundation  
**Goals:** Build the minimal end-to-end pipeline for SELECT queries. The system should accept a natural-language instruction and return JSON results from a simple SQL query.  

- **Integrate ChatGPT SDK:** Use the OpenAI Python SDK to call the ChatGPT model. Design a system prompt and user prompt that include the target database schema (table and column names) so the model knows the context ([How to better prompt when doing SQL question-answering | ️ LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/sql_prompting/#:~:text=match%20at%20L429%20schema,of%20rows%20from%20each%20table)). For example, provide a brief schema description like `Users(id, name, age, country)` in the prompt so that ChatGPT can generate a valid `SELECT` statement ([How to better prompt when doing SQL question-answering | ️ LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/sql_prompting/#:~:text=match%20at%20L429%20schema,of%20rows%20from%20each%20table)). Set a low temperature (e.g. 0 or 0.2) for determinism and ask for JSON output explicitly (see below).  
- **Prompt-to-SQL logic:** Develop prompt templates guiding the LLM to produce syntactically correct SQL `SELECT` statements. Use few-shot examples or schema context to minimize hallucinations. According to best practices, always include the exact table and column names in the prompt so the model doesn’t invent nonexistent fields ([How to better prompt when doing SQL question-answering | ️ LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/sql_prompting/#:~:text=match%20at%20L429%20schema,of%20rows%20from%20each%20table)). Start with single-table, simple queries (no JOINs) to validate the core logic.  
- **LangGraph integration:** Create a single LangGraph node (or simple chain) for sprint 1 that takes the user prompt, invokes the LLM, and returns the LLM’s response. In this sprint, the LangGraph workflow can be trivial (one node). Focus on wiring up the graph framework and ensuring inputs/outputs flow correctly.  
- **SQL execution class:** Implement a Python class (e.g. `SQLConnector`) with methods like `execute_query(sql: str) -> List[Dict]`. This class handles connecting to the SQL database (e.g. SQLite or Postgres) and running the query. Use parameterized queries or a safe execution method to mitigate SQL injection.  
- **JSON formatting:** After running the SQL, convert the result rows to a JSON structure (e.g. a list of JSON objects). Ensure the ChatGPT output (the SQL string) is extracted cleanly. One approach is to instruct the model to output only the SQL, or to use a post-processing step to parse out the SQL. In testing, verify that the LLM’s response contains a valid SQL query (e.g. using regex or a simple SQL parser).  
- **Output Delivery:** Return the query results as JSON. Use OpenAI’s JSON-output mode or instructions to ensure machine-readable output ([openai api - How to prompt chatGPT API to give completely machine-readable responses, without superfluous commentary? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76185628/how-to-prompt-chatgpt-api-to-give-completely-machine-readable-responses-without#:~:text=Functions%20are%20something%20different%2C%20but,mode)) ([openai api - How to prompt chatGPT API to give completely machine-readable responses, without superfluous commentary? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76185628/how-to-prompt-chatgpt-api-to-give-completely-machine-readable-responses-without#:~:text=Return%20results%20in%20JSON%20format,)). For example, the system prompt might say “**Output** your answer in JSON format with key `"results"` for the query output.” If needed, follow techniques like giving an explicit JSON schema example in the prompt to coax the model (e.g. “Return results in JSON like `{ "results": [...] }` ([openai api - How to prompt chatGPT API to give completely machine-readable responses, without superfluous commentary? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76185628/how-to-prompt-chatgpt-api-to-give-completely-machine-readable-responses-without#:~:text=Return%20results%20in%20JSON%20format,))”).  

**Deliverables (sprint 1):** A working prototype where: (a) a natural-language prompt is sent to ChatGPT, (b) the LLM returns an SQL `SELECT` statement, (c) the system executes this statement on a test SQL database, and (d) the JSON results are sent back to the user. All pieces should be connected end-to-end with basic logging to trace the SQL generated and the output returned.  

## sprint 2: Core – Enhanced Functionality  
**Goals:** Extend the system to support more SQL operations and handle larger datasets efficiently.  

- **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE support:** Expand the prompt templates and logic so that the user can request data modifications (e.g. “Add a new row…” or “Update the salary of employee X”). Develop the LLM prompt engineering to distinguish query types. Implement corresponding methods in `SQLConnector` (e.g. `execute_update`, `execute_insert`) and ensure transactions are handled safely (commit on success, rollback on error). For each new SQL type, add test cases to verify correctness.  
- **Query validation and safety:** Critically, introduce a validation step before execution. Use techniques like SQL parsing or a whitelist of allowed operations/columns to prevent SQL injection or malicious queries. As highlighted in similar Text-to-SQL agents, rigorous query validation is essential to prevent SQL injection or unintended data changes ([AI Agent for Text2SQL: The Magical Recipe for Natural Database Interactions - hiberus blog - Exploring Technology, AI, and Digital Experiences](https://www.hiberus.com/en/blog/ai-agent-for-text2sql/#:~:text=1.%20Rock,Interaction%3A%20Understands%20plain%20English%20queries)). For example, if ChatGPT’s output fails basic syntax checks or contains disallowed keywords, abort the execution. Consider running the SQL in a dry-run mode or on a sandbox for verification.  
- **Large result handling and pagination:** For queries that return many rows, implement pagination. The system can automatically add `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` clauses or use keyset pagination to fetch results in batches. Keyset pagination (a “seek method”) is generally more efficient on large tables and avoids heavy offset costs ([SQL — Pagination, You Are Probably Doing It Wrong | by Oliver de Cramer | The Startup | Medium](https://medium.com/swlh/sql-pagination-you-are-probably-doing-it-wrong-d0f2719cc166#:~:text=Using%20a%20seek%20method%2Fkeyset%20pagination,you%20have%2010%20Million%20rows)). For instance, after the first page of results, include the last retrieved key in the state and ask the LLM for “next page” on that basis. Provide `page_size` parameters in the interface so users can control result volume. Test performance on large mock datasets to ensure the connector and query engine handle high volume without timing out.  
- **Performance optimizations:** Ensure the SQL database has appropriate indexes for common queries (especially used in prompts) and reuse connections or a connection pool. Since this is a prototype, priority is on functionality, but plan for scalability: e.g. use asynchronous query execution or streaming results if needed. Monitor query execution time and refine prompts if the model generates extremely complex queries (e.g. too many nested subqueries) that slow down execution.  
- **Enhanced JSON formatting:** Maintain strict JSON output. If necessary, post-process the LLM output by parsing out the JSON (e.g. using an extractor function as in ([openai api - How to prompt chatGPT API to give completely machine-readable responses, without superfluous commentary? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76185628/how-to-prompt-chatgpt-api-to-give-completely-machine-readable-responses-without#:~:text=Return%20results%20in%20JSON%20format,))), or switch to OpenAI’s structured JSON mode ([openai api - How to prompt chatGPT API to give completely machine-readable responses, without superfluous commentary? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76185628/how-to-prompt-chatgpt-api-to-give-completely-machine-readable-responses-without#:~:text=Functions%20are%20something%20different%2C%20but,mode)) to enforce the schema. Validate that the final JSON matches the expected schema (e.g. an array of records).  

**Deliverables (sprint 2):** The system now handles INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE and returns results for multi-row SELECTs in pages. Extensive tests demonstrate: successful data modification operations, correct handling of multi-page queries, and that query validation is catching errors. Document any performance benchmarks and outline how pagination behaves.  

## sprint 3: Extensibility – Connector Integration  
**Goals:** Add connectors for NoSQL (MongoDB) and file storage (Google Drive), and refactor the system into a plug-and-play modular design.  

- **Modular class architecture:** Refactor the sprint 1-2 code so that each data source type is encapsulated in its own class. For example, create `MongoConnector` with methods like `find(query)`, `insert_one(doc)`, `update_many(filter, update)`, etc. Similarly, create `DriveConnector` with methods like `list_files(query: str)` and `download_file(file_id)`. Each class should act like an MCP server: exposing “resources” (data retrieval) and “tools” (actions) that the LLM can invoke ([mcp-python-sdk – User's blog](https://streetsdigital.com/2025/04/04/mcp-python-sdk/#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20,MCP%20servers%20can)). In practice, this means each method is independent and stateless (aside from DB session), allowing easy orchestration by LangGraph.  
- **MongoDB connector:** Implement the MongoDB class using a Python driver (e.g. PyMongo). The LLM prompts will now sometimes result in MongoDB actions. For example, given “Find all orders from customer X”, ChatGPT can generate a MongoDB `find()` query (e.g. `{"customer": "X"}`) and the connector will execute it. ChatGPT is capable of formulating MongoDB JSON queries from text ([MongoDB: Query Writing With ChatGPT - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dmytrych/how-to-write-mongodb-queries-using-chatgpt-no6#:~:text=Even%20the%20simplest%20MongoDB%20query,words%20into%20the%20working%20query)); provide context such as collection names and field names in the prompt to guide it. Test queries like inserts/updates as well. Ensure the output of Mongo queries is returned as JSON (it already is, usually).  
- **Google Drive connector:** Use the Google Drive API (via an official client) to implement file listing and downloading. For example, `files.list()` can retrieve file metadata, and `files.get()` can download contents ([Search for files and folders  |  Google Drive  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/search-files#:~:text=The%20Google%20Drive%20API%20supports,to%20search%20files%20and%20folders)). The user prompts could be things like “List all sales reports from last month” – the LLM or a post-filter could then apply file name/date filters. For MVP scope, start with simple operations: “list files in this folder” or “download file with ID X”. Handle authentication (use a service account or OAuth flow as appropriate). Return file metadata or file contents (as base64 or text) in JSON.  
- **LangGraph orchestration:** Define separate LangGraph nodes for SQLConnector, MongoConnector, and DriveConnector. The graph can route requests based on the LLM’s parsed intent or keywords. For example, a router node could ask ChatGPT “Is this query for SQL, MongoDB, or Drive?” and branch accordingly. Alternatively, incorporate a multi-step LangGraph flow where the LLM first classifies the action, then calls the appropriate connector node. LangGraph’s DAG makes it easy to plug in new nodes without changing core logic ([AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://blog.apify.com/ai-agent-orchestration/#:~:text=Graph,making%20when%20needed)).  
- **Plug-and-play design:** Ensure that adding a new connector (say for another API) only requires creating a new class and adding a node. Avoid hard-coding data types; use interfaces or base classes if needed. The LangGraph approach inherently supports modular tasks: each connector node simply provides outputs for the next step. Reflect this in code structure and documentation.  

**Deliverables (sprint 3):** A fully modular system where the core ChatGPT-to-action flow remains the same but supports SQL, MongoDB, and Drive. Example: “Upload file X to Google Drive” should invoke the DriveConnector; “Create new user in database” calls SQLConnector insert; “Find items costing >$50” can trigger the MongoConnector find. The system should demonstrate seamless switching between connectors. The codebase should be organized into clear modules/classes for each data source, and LangGraph definitions for each node (with a unified interface).  

## Module and Component Breakdown  
To implement the above roadmap, we propose the following key components and modules (each as a Python class or module):

- **`PromptHandler` / `QueryPlanner`:** Manages prompt templates and pre-processing. Contains system prompts (e.g. instructions for JSON output) and few-shot examples for each query type. May include utility functions to insert schema/collection info into prompts.  
- **`ChatGPTClient`:** A wrapper around the OpenAI Python SDK that handles API calls to ChatGPT. This ensures consistent parameters (model, temperature, messages format) and error handling (retries). Can also include a JSON extractor to parse ChatGPT’s responses into usable output.  
- **`LangGraphCoordinator`:** Defines the LangGraph state machine or graph structure. Includes nodes for initial prompt processing, then branching nodes for SQL, MongoDB, and Drive connectors. Encodes the control flow between nodes (e.g., after classification, call the right connector node).  
- **`SQLConnector` class:** Handles all SQL database actions. Methods include `execute_select(query: str)`, `execute_insert(query: str)`, `execute_update(query: str)`, etc. Manages DB connection (e.g. via SQLAlchemy or psycopg2) and commits. Also includes a method to return table schemas (for prompt context).  
- **`MongoConnector` class:** Handles MongoDB operations. Methods include `find(query: dict)`, `insert_one(doc: dict)`, `update_many(filter: dict, update: dict)`, etc. Uses PyMongo. Ensures queries are executed on the correct database/collection.  
- **`DriveConnector` class:** Uses the Google Drive API client. Methods include `list_files(query: str)` (wraps `files().list()` with optional search query) and `download_file(file_id: str)` (wraps `files().get_media()`). Handles OAuth token refresh. Returns results as JSON (file metadata or contents).  
- **`JSONFormatter` utility:** Ensures all outputs are valid JSON. Could include helpers for JSON schema validation or cleaning up ChatGPT outputs. For example, it might strip extraneous text and parse JSON objects from the LLM response.  
- **`Logger/Monitor` module:** Logs inputs, prompts, SQL/Mongo queries, and outputs. For debugging, integrate LangSmith tracing: LangSmith can capture traces of each LangGraph execution to help diagnose issues ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/#:~:text=Set%20up%20LangSmith%20for%20LangGraph,development)).  
- **`Config` module:** Centralizes configuration (database URLs, API keys, prompt templates, pagination size, etc.).  

Each connector class will follow a tool/resource design: i.e. its methods are invoked by the LLM as “tools” (side-effect actions) or “resources” (data fetch) ([mcp-python-sdk – User's blog](https://streetsdigital.com/2025/04/04/mcp-python-sdk/#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20,MCP%20servers%20can)). The LangGraph node for each connector simply calls the appropriate method based on ChatGPT’s output. This separation of concerns makes the design extensible: for example, adding a new NoSQL store would mean adding another connector class and node.
